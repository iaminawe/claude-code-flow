# TaskMaster Integration PR

## Summary
This PR completes the TaskMaster integration for Claude-Flow, providing intelligent task generation from Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) with optional AI enhancement.

## Key Features
- ðŸ“„ **PRD Parsing**: Parse markdown PRDs to extract requirements, constraints, and features
- ðŸ¤– **AI Enhancement**: Optional AI-powered task descriptions and SPARC mode suggestions (requires Anthropic API key)
- ðŸ“‹ **Task Generation**: Create hierarchical task structures with automatic priority assignment
- ðŸ”„ **VS Code Sync**: Foundation for VS Code extension integration (sync commands implemented)
- ðŸŽ¯ **SPARC Integration**: Automatic mapping of tasks to appropriate SPARC development modes

## Changes Made
- Added complete TaskMaster implementation in `src/integrations/taskmaster/`
- Integrated TaskMaster commands into CLI (`taskmaster` command with subcommands)
- Fixed 143+ TypeScript errors for Deno compatibility
- Updated documentation to clearly distinguish implemented vs planned features
- Added working examples to README
- Created comprehensive test coverage structure

## Usage Examples
```bash
# Basic task generation
./claude-flow taskmaster generate requirements.prd --output tasks.json

# With AI enhancement
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-key'
./claude-flow taskmaster generate requirements.prd --ai --detailed --enhance

# List stored data
./claude-flow taskmaster list

# Sync placeholder
./claude-flow taskmaster sync
```

## Technical Details
- Fixed all import paths to use `.ts` extensions for Deno
- Added proper `node:` and `npm:` prefixes for imports
- Implemented graceful fallback when AI API key is not available
- Created modular architecture for easy extension

## Testing
- Core functionality tested and working
- AI enhancement tested with and without API key
- CLI commands verified
- Basic examples included in `examples/` directory

## Documentation
- Updated `docs/13-taskmaster-integration.md` with accurate feature status
- Added `TASKMASTER_SUMMARY.md` with implementation details
- Updated README with working examples
- Removed outdated documentation files

## Future Enhancements
- Complete VS Code extension implementation
