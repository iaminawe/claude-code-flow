# TaskMaster-Swarm Integration PRD

## Overview
This document outlines requirements for integrating TaskMaster's PRD-driven task generation with Claude-Flow's swarm orchestration system. The integration will enable automatic execution of TaskMaster-generated tasks by multiple AI agents working in parallel, dramatically accelerating project completion while maintaining quality through SPARC methodology.
