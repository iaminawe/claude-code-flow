```

### 3. Command Integration
```bash
# New integrated commands
claude-flow task generate-from-prd <prd-file> --model <ai-model>
claude-flow task import-taskmaster <taskmaster-dir>

claude-flow task next --context-aware
```

### 4. Workflow Integration
- Task Master generates initial task breakdown
- Claude-Flow orchestrates execution with dependencies
- SPARC modes handle implementation
- Memory system tracks progress and learnings

   - Create `task next` with context awareness

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (Week 3-4)
1. **Model Selection Logic**
   - Implement intelligent model selection based on task type
   - Add model performance tracking
   - Create model switching interface

2. **PRD Integration**
   - Automatic PRD parsing on project initialization
   - Dynamic task generation as PRD evolves
